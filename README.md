# kubernetes topology aware scheduling working group

## who is part of this working group?

The main contributors and maintainers of this working group are:
- Alexey Perelov (@AlexeyPerelov)
- Artyom Lukianov (@cyneoco3hahue)
- Francesco Romani (@fromanirh)
- Swati Sehgal (@swatisehgal)
- Talor Itzhak (@Tal-or)

please check the git logs to track every contribution.

 NOTE: This is a working group in the general, english sense of the word ["working group"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_group) defined as "A group of experts working together to achieve specified goals" and not a official Kubenetes working group. While we want to cooperate with Kubenetes, we don't have official endorsement or acknowledgement.

## what is the purpose of this organization?

This organization is a temporary place we use to coordinate and to gather all the bits and pieces we need to implement the topology-aware scheduling while we work towards the merge of the changes in the relevant upstream projects.

We acknowledge this process may still take some time to complete and we will need to require few components to have a working, easy to try, solution.

So, the main and only purpose of the organization who backs the working group is to make easier to coordinate for us, which we contribute code changes, and for everyone else which wants to join the effort or even to try our solution out.

Instead of having all the forks, patches, tools, scattered between our own github personal accounts, everything will be under this organization..

Please note that the goal of this working group is the *upstream integration*.
This means the repositories and the organization itself will have a limited lifetime. Once all the changes we propose will get merged in the various u/s projects (kubernetes, node-feature-discovery...)
the forks and the repositories here will be put in maintenance mode and frozen forever.

We *do not* plan to keep permanent forks or to maintain components under this organization. 


## what does this repository contain?

This repository contain generic documentation which doesn't belong to specific repositories, maybe because, like this README, covers the organization, or because covers general topics.
